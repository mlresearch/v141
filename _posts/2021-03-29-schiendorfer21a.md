title: Turning Software Engineers into Machine Learning Engineers
abstract: A first challenge in teaching machine learning to software engineering and
  computer science students consists of changing the methodology from a constructive
  design-first perspective to an empirical one, focusing on proper experimental work.
  On the other hand, students nowadays can make significant progress using existing
  scripts and powerful (deep) learning frameworks – focusing on established use cases
  such as vision tasks. To tackle problems in novel application domains, a clean methodological
  style is indispensable. Additionally, for deep learning, familiarity with gradient
  dynamics is crucial to understand deeper models. Consequently, we present three
  exercises that build upon each other to achieve these goals. These exercises are
  validated experimentally in a master’s level course for software engineers.
