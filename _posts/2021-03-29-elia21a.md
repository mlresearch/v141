title: An Interactive Web Application for Decision Tree Learning
abstract: Decision tree learning offers an intuitive and straightforward introduction
  to machine learning techniques, especially when students are used to program imperative
  code. Most commonly, trees are trained using a greedy algorithm based on information-theoretic
  criteria. While there are many static resources such as slides or animations out
  there, interactive visualizations tend to be based on somewhat outdated UI technology
  and dense in information. We propose a clean and simple web application for decision
  tree learning that is extensible and open source.
