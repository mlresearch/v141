title: AI is not Just a Technology
abstract: Reporting on our experiences introducing a broad range of staff of academic
  libraries to AI, we suggest that training in practical applications of AI requires
  more than learning the technology. AI projects in libraries require contributions
  by computing specialists, subject specialists, metadata librarians, conservators,
  and others; each bringing different expertise and competencies to the project. We
  offer an integrated approach to knowledge building in AI that considers the processes
  and roles involved. This approach takes a comprehensive view of the entire AI project
  from understanding the need, translating that need into tasks, identifying and preparing
  the data, applying methods, and evaluating the results.
