title: Teaching the Foundations of Machine Learning with Candy
abstract: Machine learning is ubiquitous in decision-making processes across society.
  The presence and development of ML drives a need for improved education in key concepts
  at the secondary and tertiary levels that not only trains people to become informed
  citizens but also trains future researchers to be both principled and ethical practitioners.
  In this vein, we present a structured classroom activity that simultaneously teaches
  both supervised classification and critically thinking about ML applications and
  ethics. We use an active, object-based learning approach to teach supervised classification
  using a variety of candies, and a problem-based scenario to encourage critical questions
  about ethics in ML applications.
