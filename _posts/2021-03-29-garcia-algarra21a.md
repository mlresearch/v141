title: Introductory Machine Learning for non STEM students
abstract: Data Science in general, and Machine Learning in particular, is a powerful
  tool for decision-makers across non-STEM fields like Human Resources Management,
  Law or Marketing.  Introductory Machine  Learning,  for  non-majors  that  lack  a
  strong background in Statistics and Computer Science, is a challenge for both teacher
  and students. The use of similes and games is a soft way to deal with definitions
  of concepts and procedures that are essential for further advanced courses on these
  subjects.
