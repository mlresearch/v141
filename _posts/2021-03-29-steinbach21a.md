title: Teaching Machine Learning in 2020
abstract: Faced by the abundant use of machine learning in industry and academia,
  the effective and efficient teaching of core concepts in this field becomes of high
  importance. For this, we organized a workshop on teaching methods in the field of
  machine learning. In this document, we summarize the current standing of the community
  as by our workshop and their methods. We touch on existing working concepts in machine
  learning didactics, what methods present initiatives use and cover open teaching
  resources available to date. With this, we hope to provide a starting point for
  future collaborations on this central topic given the expanding use of machine learning
  in science, industry and our daily lives.
