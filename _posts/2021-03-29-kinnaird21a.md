title: Teaching Computational Machine Learning (without Statistics)
abstract: This paper presents an undergraduate machine learning course that emphasizes
  algorithmic understanding and programming skills while assuming no statistical training.
  Emphasizing the development of good habits of mind, this course trains students
  to be independent machine learning practitioners through an iterative, cyclical
  framework for teaching concepts while adding increasing depth and nuance. Beginning
  with unsupervised learning, this course is sequenced as a series of machine learning
  ideas and concepts with specific algorithms acting as concrete examples. This paper
  also details course organization including evaluation practices and logistics.
